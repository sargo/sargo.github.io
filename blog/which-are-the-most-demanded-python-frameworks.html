Models are defined using Django ORM. SQL databases are mainly used as storage. Django has a built-in admin panel, allowing for easy management of the database content.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">With minimal configuration this panel is automatically generated based on the defined models. Views can include both functions and classes. The assignment of URLs to views is done in one place (the <span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://urls.py" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 100933615);" class="external_link">http://urls.py</a></span> file), so that after reviewing that single file you can learn what URLs are supported. Templates are created using a fairly simple <b>Django Templates system.</b></p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">Django is praised for strong community support, and for detailed documentation describing the functionality of the framework. This documentation coupled with the fact that after the installation you get a complete environment, the entry threshold is rather low. After going through <span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 100933615);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="djangoproject.com">the official tutorial</a></span>, you’ll be able to do most of the things needed to build an application.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">Unfortunately, Django’s monolithism also has its drawbacks. It’s difficult, though not impossible, to replace one of the built-in elements with another implementation. For example, using some other ORM (e.g. SQLAlchemy) requires abandoning or completely rebuilding such items as the admin panel, authorization, session handling or generating forms.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">Because Django is complete but inflexible, it is suitable for standard applications (i.e. the vast majority of software projects). However, if you need to implement some unconventional design, it leads to a struggle with the framework rather than pleasant programming.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr"><b>Flask</b></p><div class="ui_qtext_image_outer"><div class="ui_qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-99cc54da195b94728d8604ba2d1db17b" master_src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a0eaccc603cf881244fb561436626e7c" master_w="954" master_h="378"></div></div><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr"><b>image source: </b><span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 100933615);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="fullstackpython.com"><b>Flask</b></a></span></p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">Flask is considered a<b> micro-framework.</b> It comes with basic functionality, but also allows you to easily expand it. Therefore, Flask works more as the glue that allows you to join libraries with each other. For example, “pure Flask” does not provide support for any storage, but there are a number of different implementations that you can install and use interchangeably for that purpose (e.g. Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-MongoAlchemy, and Flask-Redis). Similarly, the basic template system is Jinja2, but you can use a replacement (e.g. Mako).</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">The motto of this framework is “one drop at a time”, and this is reflected in its comprehensive documentation. Knowledge of how to build an application is acquired in portions here – after reading a few paragraphs, you will be able to perform basic tasks. You do not have to know the more advanced stuff – you’ll get to learn it only when you need it. Thanks to this, the Flask student can gather knowledge smoothly and avoid boredom, making Flask suitable for learning.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">A large number of<b> Flask extensions</b>, unfortunately, are not as well supported as the framework itself. It happens quite often that the plug-ins are no longer being developed or their documentation is not outdated. In such situations, you need to spend some time googling a replacement that offers similar functionality, but is still actively supported. Building your application with packages from different authors, you might have to put quite a bit of sweat into integrating them with each other. You will rarely find ready-made instructions how to do this in the plug-ins’ documentation, but in such situations the flask community and websites such as Stack Overflow may be helpful.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr"><b>Pyramid</b></p><div class="ui_qtext_image_outer"><div class="ui_qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ccbf45f5a68d3bc2306fa3c86f834867" master_src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-326955c896f43c6b133802d4f875d5cf" master_w="1073" master_h="493"></div></div><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr"><b>image source: </b><span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/pyramid.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 100933615);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="fullstackpython.com"><b>Pyramid</b></a></span></p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">A third noteworthy web framework called<b> Pyramid </b>is rooted in two other products which are no longer developed: Pylons and repoze.bfg. The legacy left by its predecessors caused Pyramid to evolve into a very mature and stable project.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">The philosophies of Pyramid and Django differ substantially, even though both were born in the same year (2005). Unlike Django, <b>Pyramid is trivial to customize</b>, allowing you to create features in ways that were not foreseen by the authors of the framework. It does not force the programmer to use framework’s idioms. It’s meant to be a solid scaffolding for complex or highly non-standard projects.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">Pyramid strives to be<b> persistence-agnostic</b>. There is no bundled database access module, but a common practice is to combine Pyramid with the powerful, mature SQLAlchemy ORM. Of course, that’s only the most popular way to go. Programmers are free to use whatever tool they find useful, such as using peewee ORM instead, writing raw SQL queries or integrating with a NoSQL database, just to name a few. All options are open, though this approach requires a bit of experience to smoothly add the desired persistence mechanism to the project. The same goes for other components, such as templating.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">This summarizes what Pyramid is all about. Modules bundled with it relate to the web layer only. Users are encouraged to freely choose 3rd party packages that will support other aspects of their project.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">However, this model causes a noticeable overhead at the beginning of any new project, because you have to spend some time choosing and integrating tools that the team is comfortable with. Still, once you put the effort into making extra decisions in the beginning, you are rewarded with a setup that makes it easy to start a new project and comfortable to develop it further.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">Pyramid’s motto is<b> "The Start Small, Finish Big Stay Finished Framework"</b>.<b> </b>This makes it an appropriate tool for experienced developers who are not afraid of putting a lot of extra work in the beginning, without shipping any feature within the first few days. Less experienced programmers may feel a bit intimidated.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr"><b>Web2py</b></p><div class="ui_qtext_image_outer"><div class="ui_qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9cc53dba1342f755d1b53ad65d7ab355" master_src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b5ae67c6b1f1bb482797045e80e614dc" master_w="1600" master_h="325"></div></div><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr"><b>image source: </b><span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://realpython.com/web2py-migrating-from-sqlite-to-mysql/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 100933615);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="realpython.com"><b>Web2py – Migrating from SQLite to MySQL – Real Python</b></a></span></p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">Born in 2007, <b>web2py </b>is a framework that was originally designed as a teaching tool for students, so the authors’ main concern was ease of development and deployment.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">web2py is<b> strongly inspired by Django and Ruby On Rails</b>, sharing the idea of convention over configuration. In other words web2py provides many sensible defaults that allow developers to get off the ground quickly.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">This approach also means there are a lot of goodies bundled with web2py. You will find everything that you expect from a web framework in web2py, including a built-in server, html generating helpers, forms, validators and many more - nothing unusual so far. Support for multiple database engines is nice, though a quite common asset among current web frameworks.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">However, some other bundled features may surprise you, since they are not present in other frameworks:</p><ul><li>helpers for creating javascript-enabled sites with jQuery and Ajax,</li><li>scheduler and cron,</li><li>2-factor authentication helpers,</li><li>sending SMS messages,</li><li>an event ticketing system, allowing for automatic assigning of problems that occurred in production environment to a developer!</li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">The framework proudly claims to be a<b> full-stack solution</b>, providing everything you may ever need.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">web2py has extensive documentation available online. It guides newcomers step by step, starting with a short introduction to the Python language. The introduction is seamlessly linked with the rest of the manual that demonstrates different aspects of web2py in a friendly manner, with a lot of code snippets and screenshots.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">Despite all its competitive advantages, web2py's community is significantly smaller than Django's or even Pyramid's. Fewer developers using it means your chances of getting help and support are lower. The official mailing list is mostly inactive.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr"><b>Sanic</b></p><div class="ui_qtext_image_outer"><div class="ui_qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-60f55da19e5e2fe05dd2fed289909e8f" master_src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-af22a79367b2a97fa488aa07d678edfa" master_w="1600" master_h="704"></div></div><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr"><b>image source: </b><span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/sanic.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 100933615);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="fullstackpython.com"><b>Sanic</b></a></span></p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr"><b>Sanic </b>differs considerably from the aforementioned frameworks because unlike them, it is based on asyncio - Python’s toolbox for asynchronous programming, bundled with the standard library starting from version 3.4.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">In order to develop projects based on Sanic, <b>one has to grasp the ideas behind asyncio first</b>. This involves a lot of theoretical knowledge about coroutines, concurrent programming caveats and carefully reasoning about the data flow in the application.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">Once a developer gets the idea and applies Sanic/asyncio to an appropriate problem, the effort pays off. Sanic is especially handy when it comes to coping with long-living connections, such as websockets.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">Another use case is writing a “glue-web application”, that can be a mediator between two subsystems with incompatible APIs.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">On the other hand, Sanic will not be a good choice for simple CRUD applications that only perform basic database operations. It would just make them more complicated with no visible benefit.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr"><b>Sanic is meant to be very fast</b>. One of its dependencies is <span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 100933615);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="github.com">uvloop</a></span> - an alternative, drop-in replacement for asyncio’s not-so-good built-in event loop. uvloop is a wrapper around libuv. The same engine powers node.js. According to the uvloop documentation, this makes asyncio work 2-4 times faster.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">In terms of “what’s in the box”,<b> Sanic does not offer as much as other frameworks</b>. It is a micro-framework, just like Flask. Apart from routing and other basic web-related goodies like utilities for handling cookies and streaming responses, there is not much inside. <b>Sanic imitates Flask</b>, for example by sharing the concept of Blueprints - tiny sub-applications, letting developers split and organize their code in bigger applications.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr">Sanic is a great choice for projects requiring support for websockets or making a lot of long-lasting external API calls. Please note it requires at least Python 3.5.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr"><b>If you’d like to read about some of these frameworks in greater detail, or learn about additional ones, read this article: </b><span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://stxnext.com/blog/2017/03/22/beginners-introduction-python-frameworks/?utm_campaign=2018-09-wl&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=quora" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 100933615);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="stxnext.com"><b>A Beginner’s Introduction to Python Web Frameworks</b></a></span></p></span></div></div>
